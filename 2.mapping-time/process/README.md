Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data → retinal variables mapping.

For this set of clocks:

orange = hours
green = minutes
blue = seconds


Clock 1: This clock is a 24 hour clock represented by 3 bands:

orange = hours
green = minutes
blue = seconds

Outer ring is a divided into 24 sections telling the hour in the day. The brighter side is the morning hours transitioning into the dark part of the circle which represents the nigh-time.

Middle Ring and Inner ring are divided into 60 parts. The brighter part starts at 1 and the darker side is 60.


Clock 2: The hours is dictated by where the large dial is pointed to in regards to a conventional clock. Minutes are depicted by the smaller hand gradient is strongest. Seconds is depicted in the minutes hand fill as a gradient–the shape increases its fill as the seconds grow. When the time switches from AM to PM the colors flip.


Clock 3: This clock goes by 24 hours clock.

orange = hours
green = minutes
blue = seconds

Here two clocks are stacked onto of each other. The clock starts at the top and does a S shape on the clock forming an 8. The cubes rotate upon the center of the first circle until it reaches 6 where it will continue onto the center rotation of the bottom circle.


Calendar:

Calendar 1: The date and month are unhidden and revealed.

Calendar 2:

	The colors: the color band is divided into 12 shades between the orange (January) and Navy (December).

	The Day: The position of the sqaure represents the day of the month. The day marker is centered with the day (which is calculated by dividing the width of the shape into X days (depending on month)).


Calendar 3:

	The months: each line represents a month, starting with january on the top, and tyhe bold line is the current month.
	The days: the days are depicted by the placement of the circle



Hyberid Sketches:

Sketch 1: 1:15:16 December 5.

For this clock I create a dot grid 12 x 5. All inactive dots are small with a stroke. Hours are depicted by which colummn has enlarged dots. Minutes is depicted by a dot being filled with no stroke. Seconds are depicted with a stroke around wher ethe large dots would be (from the hours). All dots that have  been passed remain in the active state.

For the calendar: The months grid is created by a division of 12 squares with a stroke–the active month becomes a stroked circle with no fill. Days of the month are shown with dots with a stroke and no fill–active days get filled dots. Seasons are depicted by the color of the month (fall: organge; winter: blue; spring: green; summer: yellow).

Sketch 2:

This clock and cal is created with a base grid of 12 x 12.

The clock takes up 5 X 12 on the left side and the calendar uses the other 7 x 12 on the right side.

Hours is depicted by an added stroke to the given row. Seconds are shown through a shruken square. Minutes is depicted with a fill.

Day of the week is depicted by a stroke on the right row. month is depicted by row. season is depicted by color of filled box


Sketch 3:

This sketch lays on an x/y plotting graph. AM time is represented by circles and PM time is represented in triangles. For both of these shapes, minutes is depicted in the largest sized shape with a stroke and no fill. Seconds is depicted in the smalled shape with no stroke but a fill. Hours are depicted using the smallest shape with a stroke and no fill.

Days are depicted on the Y axis: the seconds, minutes, and hour shapes are placed vertically depending on the day (starting with monday on the top and sunday on the bottom). Months are depicted as a sqaure with a stroke and no fill, vertically centered (left is january and the right is december).
