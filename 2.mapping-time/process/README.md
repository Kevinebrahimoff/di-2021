For this set of clocks:

orange = hours
green = minutes
blue = seconds


Clock 1: This clock is a 24 hour clock represented by 3 bands:

orange = hours
green = minutes
blue = seconds

Outer ring is a divided into 24 sections telling the hour in the day. The brighter side is the morning hours transitioning into the dark part of the circle which represents the nigh-time.

Middle Ring and Inner ring are divided into 60 parts. The brighter part starts at 1 and the darker side is 60.


Clock 2: The hours is dictated by where the large dial is pointed to in regards to a conventional clock. Minutes are depicted by the smaller hand gradient is strongest. Seconds is depicted in the minutes hand fill as a gradient–the shape increases its fill as the seconds grow. When the time switches from AM to PM the colors flip.


Clock 3: This clock goes by 24 hours clock.

orange = hours
green = minutes
blue = seconds

Here two clocks are stacked onto of each other. The clock starts at the top and does a S shape on the clock forming an 8. The cubes rotate upon the center of the first circle until it reaches 6 where it will continue onto the center rotation of the bottom circle.
